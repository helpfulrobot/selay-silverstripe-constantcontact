=================
A simple ajax-based Constant Contact signup widget/module for Silverstripe -> fully customizable in CMS Settings.  

## Requirements

* PHP PHP 5.3+ with cURL extension for API
* [Silverstripe Multivaluefield](https://github.com/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-multivaluefield).

## Features
* Easy to setup under CMS settings by setting error/success messages/API details and input field classes
* Uses Constant Contact PHP SDK for v2 API to add/update contact lists. Full SDK is provided for your own extension.
* No need to configure at the config file level. Just configure in CMS.
* Supports contact submission to single and multile lists. Options allow setting the submission to a single, selected, or all lists. All available lists are pulled via API, and shown in CMS. If you select only one list, the lists checkbox will not be shown in the front-end. If more than one, they will be displayed as checkboxes. If left empty, all available lists will be listed as checkboxes so that customers can choose which list they want to sign up.
